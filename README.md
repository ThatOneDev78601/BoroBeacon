## 🚀 Quick Start

To get BoroBeacon up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   **Node.js**: `^18.x` or higher
-   **npm** or **Yarn**:
    ```bash
    npm install -g yarn # If you prefer yarn
    ```
-   **Watchman** (for macOS React Native development):
    ```bash
    brew install watchman
    ```
-   **React Native Development Environment**:
    -   **Android**: Java Development Kit (JDK), Android Studio with Android SDK and emulator setup.
    -   **iOS**: Xcode with Command Line Tools and iOS simulator setup (macOS only).
    -   Refer to the [React Native Environment Setup Guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) for detailed instructions.
-   **Firebase Project**: An active Firebase project with Firestore enabled.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ThatOneDev78601/BoroBeacon.git
    cd BoroBeacon
    ```

2.  **Firebase Project Setup**
    *   Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Create a new project.
    *   Enable **Firestore Database** in Native mode.
    *   **Authentication**: Set up preferred authentication methods (e.g., Email/Password).
    *   **Project Settings**: Add a new web app to your Firebase project to get your configuration details.

3.  **Frontend (Mobile App) Setup**

    *   Navigate to the `Frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd Frontend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        ```
    *   Configure environment variables:
        Create a `.env` file in the `Frontend` directory based on `.env.example` (if present) or manually add your Firebase configuration:
        ```env
        # Frontend/.env
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID
        EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID # Optional
        ```
        Replace placeholders with your actual Firebase project configuration.

    *   Start the React Native development server:
        ```bash
        npx expo start
        # or
        npm start
        ```
        This will open Metro Bundler in your browser. You can then scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your phone, or run it on an Android emulator/iOS simulator by pressing `a` or `i` respectively in the terminal.

4.  **Backend (API Service) Setup**

    *   Open a new terminal and navigate to the `Backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd Backend
        ```
    *   Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # or
        yarn install
        ```
    *   Configure environment variables:
        Create a `.env` file in the `Backend` directory based on `.env.example` (if present) or manually add your Firebase configuration. This might include credentials for Admin SDK:
        ```env
        # Backend/.env
        FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY_ID
        FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
        FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
        FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=YOUR_FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL
        # Potentially other backend specific configs like PORT
        PORT=3000
        ```
        For `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` and `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, you'll need to generate a private key for your Firebase project service account in the Firebase Console (Project settings > Service accounts > Generate new private key).

    *   Start the Backend server:
        ```bash
        npm start
        # or
        yarn start
        ```
        The backend service will likely run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port defined in your `.env`).

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Both the `Frontend` and `Backend` applications rely on environment variables for sensitive configurations, primarily related to Firebase.

**Frontend (`Frontend/.env`):**

| Variable                       | Description                                       | Default | Required |
| :----------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------ | :------- |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY` | Your Firebase project's API Key.                  |         | Yes      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN` | Your Firebase project's Auth Domain.              |         | Yes      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | Your Firebase project's unique ID.                |         | Yes      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` | Your Firebase project's Storage Bucket.           |         | Yes      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID` | Your Firebase project's Messaging Sender ID.      |         | Yes      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`  | Your Firebase project's Web App ID.               |         | Yes      |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID` | Your Firebase project's Measurement ID (for Analytics). |         | No       |

**Backend (`Backend/.env`):**

| Variable                  | Description                                            | Default | Required |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------ | :------- |

### Firebase Security Rules

Ensure your Firestore security rules are configured to allow appropriate read/write access based on user authentication and roles. Example (adjust as needed for your specific data model):

```firestore
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users to read and write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    // Allow authenticated users to create help requests, read nearby requests
    match /requests/{requestId} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
      allow read: if request.auth != null; // Refine this with GeoFire queries in client
      allow update, delete: if request.auth.uid == resource.data.requesterId;
    }
    // Consider rules for GeoFire location data separately
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Development

### Available Scripts

Each sub-project (`Frontend` and `Backend`) has its own set of development scripts defined in their `package.json` files.

#### `Frontend` Scripts:

| Command           | Description                                                 |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`       | Starts the Expo development server.                         |
| `npm run android` | Runs the app on a connected Android device or emulator.     |
| `npm run ios`     | Runs the app on a connected iOS device or simulator.        |
| `npm test`        | Runs unit tests (if configured, likely Jest/React Native Testing Library). <!-- TODO: Confirm testing framework and update --> |
| `npm run eject`   | Ejects from Expo (use with caution, if custom native modules are needed). |

#### `Backend` Scripts:

| Command        | Description                                  |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| `npm start`    | Compiles and starts the Node.js server.      |
| `npm run dev`  | Starts the Node.js server with hot-reloading (e.g., using `nodemon` or `ts-node-dev`). <!-- Inferred --> |
| `npm run build` | Compiles TypeScript files to JavaScript.     |
| `npm test`     | Runs backend unit/integration tests. <!-- TODO: Confirm testing framework and update --> |

### Development Workflow

1.  Start the `Backend` service in one terminal.
2.  Start the `Frontend` development server in another terminal.
3.  Ensure your chosen emulator/simulator or physical device is running.
4.  Develop features in both `Frontend` and `Backend` as needed. The `Frontend` will typically reload automatically on changes.

## 🧪 Testing

Both `Frontend` and `Backend` components should have their own testing setups.

```bash
# To run frontend tests:
cd Frontend
npm test

# To run backend tests:
cd Backend
npm test
```

<!-- TODO: Specify actual testing frameworks (e.g., Jest, React Native Testing Library for frontend, Jest/Mocha/Chai for backend) and provide example test commands if available. -->

## 🚀 Deployment

### Mobile Application Deployment

The `Frontend` React Native application can be deployed to app stores (Google Play Store, Apple App Store).

-   **Expo Build**: If using Expo, you can build your app for production using `eas build`.
    ```bash
    cd Frontend
    eas build --platform android # or ios
    ```
-   **React Native CLI**: If ejected or using the bare React Native workflow, follow platform-specific guides to build and deploy your app.

### Backend Service Deployment

The `Backend` service, interacting with Firebase, is ideal for serverless deployment or a containerized environment.

-   **Firebase Cloud Functions**: If the `Backend` logic can be structured as serverless functions, Firebase Cloud Functions would be a natural fit, providing seamless integration with Firestore and other Firebase services.
-   **Cloud Run/Other Serverless**: The Node.js service could also be containerized and deployed to services like Google Cloud Run, AWS Fargate, or Azure Container Apps for scalable, serverless execution.
-   **Traditional Hosting**: For a persistent server, deploy to a VM or managed service like Google App Engine, Heroku, etc.

<!-- TODO: Add specific deployment instructions based on detected CI/CD or platform configurations. -->
